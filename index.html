              <p>We are a mobile brand that discovers, shares, and celebrates creative communities around the nation, by designing and producing a pop-up fashion collection inspired by the unique qualities of each location we visit; encouraging the start-up of independent fashion labels by local designers, through our collaboration with a local shop that will allow us to display our design process and sell our final product to the local community.</p>
               <p>Adrienne discovered graphic design in high school, fell in love, and since her childhood dreams of being a mermaid didn't happen, graphic design was the next best thing. Adrienne also has an obsession with the Disney princesses, hence the desire to be a mermaid, and also for neon colors.</p>

              <p>The Streetcar's main purpose is to attract people to downtown, while helping to circulate the pedestrian movement around the city. In order for the Streetcar to be effective in creating a pedestrian-scaled city, it must be able to function within the hustle and bustle of our diverse urban environment. To acheive this, the Streetcar requires an identity system that can connect to the city’s rich heritage, while helping to usher in a new era of urban development for the city. </p>
               <p>Since he can remember, Alex has always had an extremely vivid and active imagination. He decided to pursue design as a chance to utilize his creativity in his career. It was a good decision. Without constant creative output, Alex's head might explode. After Co-oping in various cities across the country, he is ready to keep his adventure going and is seeking a position in the EGD (environmental graphic design) field.</p>

              <p>Children often want pets, but are turned off by the responsibilities. This mobile task management app helps kids age 9 to 12 track pet care chores and learn their animal’s daily needs. The app complements pet foster programs lasting a fixed period of time. After completing the program, the parents receive the child’s results, opening opportunities for discussion on the family’s pet readiness.</p>
               <p>A proud Kentuckian, Alyssa discovered design through years of art classes. Through co-ops, she came to love interaction design. She also likes cooking, traveling, yoga, concerts, drumming, cats, dogs, and making zombie plans. Alyssa values optimism and patience, which explains her devotion to Cincinnati's professional sports teams. She knows LaRosa's pizza and Skyline Chili are the keys to world peace, and she's unsure if she looks good in hats.</p>

              <p>A large number of English words are derived from Latin, but it isn’t generally taught as a language until high school. By introducing common prefixes, bases, and suffixes to younger students, they can see how words are put together and how larger words can be broken down into their fundamental components. This educational card game, intended for students in grades 4-6, helps children identify two part and three part English words that stem from Latin. </p>
               <p>A fascination with color theory—along with a small collection of product labels and magazine ads—originally compelled Andrea to study graphic design. Her time in DAAP has been an excellent learning experience and she is grateful for the encouragement she has received from family, friends, and faculty members along the way.</p>

While the Parks themselves display the natural wonders of the state, the signs used to communicate to visitors and guide them through the park are outdated and inconsistent. The new system of signs would combine interactive elements with traditional static signs and would allow hikers to clearly identify trails and pertinent information, providing a better, more effective experience to the user.</p>

              <p>One of the greatest contributors to meltdowns and behavioral outbursts in the classroom for children with Autism is their inability to verbally communicate their wants and needs. What if classroom communication between students with Autism and their teachers could be improved, meltdowns could be prevented, and verbal communication could be encouraged with an interactive tool? Our iPad application promotes success in education by allowing children with Autism to verbally communicate their wants and needs through imagery and sound.</p>
              <p>Being visual and kinesthetic learners themselves, Annie and Sarah both entered DAAP with enthusiasm for interactive media and a desire to use the visual world as communicative art. Their combined passions for design research, interactive design, user experience design, and problem solving have guided them through many rewarding experiences.</p>

This temporary exhibit will immerse the visitor in the topic and hopefully leave a lasting impression. </p>

            <h3> Managing stress is an important skill to learn as a young adult and yoga is a simple and healthy way to do so. </h3>
            <p>ZoneOut with Yoga is an awareness campaign that encourages college students to embrace healthy stress management in the form of yoga. The goal of the campaign is to inform students that practicing yoga leads to higher levels of focus and better concentration, better work habits, and lower levels of stress by changing the way your body responds to stress in the first place.</p>
             <p>After a brief time as a college student with no declared major, Ellen found herself drawn toward the creative field. Through her co-ops, she has worked in print design, brand development and packaging, and environmental design for hospitality and retail markets and is open to exploring other desciplines of the field. She finds inspiration in all music and live concerts, photography while traveling, and cute animals from the internet. </p>

            <p>Healthy Time with Hannah is a short, educational animation designed for children's networks to help youngsters learn the importance of a healthy diet. The narrative follows Hannah through everyday activities and food choices. She encourages children to make the healthy choice, and explains how certain foods are beneficial. The goal is to make children want to choose healthy options on their own, not just because it is something they are told to do. </p>
             <p>Emily has always been a westside Cincinnati girl and die-hard Bearcats fan. It was only natural for her to attend the University of Cincinnati where she found her place in DAAP. Other than design, Emily enjoys fashion, Disney movies, leopard print, and Justin Bieber. She spends her time watching college basketball and volunteering at Children's Hospital.</p>

            <p>In 2015, the city of Cincinnati will host the MLB All Star Game, a week long event that will generate millions of dollars in revenue. Many of these attendees, an estimated 250,000, both fans and journalist will converge into the culture surrounding one of America’s favorite past times, baseball.

            <p>The current system for ballot design in the United States creates ballots riddled with poor visual communication, leading to voter errors, causing hundreds of thousands of votes to be tossed out each election. In addition to this, each county has its own ballot layout, further complicating tallying the votes.

            <h3> Educating people on the problems that are excacerbated by feeding deer in suburban/urban areas. </h3>
            <p>In Ohio and the neighboring states, there is a high-population of deer that causes problems for people living there. Car accidents, tick-borne diseases, and property damage are three of the biggest problems caused by deer and are worsened by people putting out food for them on their property. “Don’t Feed the Deer” is a series of PSAs to educate people on the problems associated with the backyard feeding of deer.</p>
             <p>Peter started his collegiate career as a pirate and has since settled on being a lumberjack, a lumberjack who enjoys animation and comedy. He also has a penchant for comics, video games, and playing bass. He sat a foot away from Amy Poehler once. That was awesome.</p>

            <h3> A Guide to Success After College Graduation </h3>
            <p>When it comes to graduating college, assuming all of the financial responsibilities many students were previously unaware of can be daunting and overwhelming. There are millions of books out there that address the topic of financing, but all of them are text heavy and not very user friendly. I am designing a book that explains these topics in a visually exciting way with pages for interaction, making the book completely personalizable, portable, and easy to understand.</p>
             <p>Rebecca has always had a love of artistic and creative things. Facilitated through schooling and a supportive family, she realized there was no better place for her than in the School of Design at DAAP (especially since there was no career to be made of creating card board elephants out of toilet paper rolls...). She has loved her years of college and is sad to see them come to an end. In her free time, she enjoys making jewelry, silversmithing, writing, and seeing the world.</p>

Through a exhibit that will travel from various high schools, students will be educated about design on a basic level, and shown that it is a viable career path.

            <p>Robin began college in architecture and quickly found herself switching to design after she wanted to do her roommate's projects and not her own. She has an adorable dog named Charlie, a love of anything and everything handmade, and hair that hasn't been its natural color since 2006. Her co-ops have taken her all across the country and she is excited to return to LA for her next chapter.</p>

            <p>The Unification Church has existed for years, and has a dominant symbol it has used, but overall, has lacked a focus in what its trying to convey. It's a way of life, therefore it has that advantage, but in order to maintain its members, and continue growth, the church needs a rebrand, and a redesign of the identity. I am creating a messaging strategy, and a visual language to convey the values of the faith that will speak to the members. </p>
            <p>Sarah has always been inclined towards the arts. It began with performing arts, and slowly moved into a visual arts, as she created drawings of her stuffed animals, and later, used all mediums of fine arts in high school. But her love of learning and friendships with peers outside of the arts showed her that she would enjoy a life and career that goes beyond just the arts. She enjoys sports, languages, traveling, working with her faith community, music, and napping.</p>
